You are an expert medical text annotator specializing in Alzheimer's and dementia. You will be given a Reddit post (with a unique "id") about a patient with dementia. Extract STRUCTURED INFORMATION about the PATIENT only (ignore the caregiver/author). If multiple patients are mentioned, focus on the MAIN patient.


Extraction Guidelines:


Age:
- If an exact age is mentioned, return it as a string (e.g., "72").
- If an age range or approximate is given, return that (e.g., "70s", "mid-60s").
- If no age info, return "unknown".
- Do not infer age from context or clues.


Gender:
- If a clear indicator exists (pronouns he/him/his or she/her/hers, or unambiguous family terms like father/mother, brother/sister, etc.), return "male" or "female".
- If ambiguous or gender-neutral, return "unknown".
- Do not guess gender from names, roles, or stereotypes; do not use caregiver's gender.


Symptoms:
- Identify all symptoms or cognitive/behavioral changes explicitly attributed to the patient. Ignore general comments and caregiver feelings.
- For each symptom described:
  - If it matches a definition in the symptom dictionary below, add the exact symptom name (with correct capitalization) to known_symptoms.
  - If it does not match any definition, create a concise term from the description and add it to rare_symptoms. (Use a precise noun or phrase; e.g., if seeing things not there, use "Hallucinations".)
- Avoid duplicates: List each symptom only once (treat "Hallucination" and "hallucinations" as the same symptom).
- Do not hallucinate: Only extract symptoms actually mentioned; do not invent or infer any others.
- If no symptoms are mentioned, set both known_symptoms and rare_symptoms to empty lists ([]).

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - STRICT MATCHING REQUIRED

A symptom can ONLY be tagged as "known_symptoms" if it matches EXACTLY (word-for-word) with one of the 29 symptom names in the dictionary below.

STRICT RULES:
- Use the EXACT symptom name from the list (including capitalization and spacing)
- DO NOT use synonyms (e.g., "Hallucinations" is NOT in the list, so tag as rare)
- DO NOT paraphrase or reword symptoms
- DO NOT infer similar meanings (e.g., "Forgetfulness" ≠ "Forgetting Recent Information")
- DO NOT add symptoms not explicitly listed
- If you're unsure or the symptom seems similar but isn't exact → tag as "rare_symptoms"

Before tagging as "known_symptoms":
1. Read the exact symptom text from the post
2. Search for an EXACT match in the 29-item dictionary below
3. If found → use exact name; If not found → create concise term for rare_symptoms
